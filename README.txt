My first python program, it's a tool to quickly organise files like pictures, videos and audios that are located in a folder. 
The script will create 3 sub-folders as 'audio', 'video' and 'img' and will move every file in his respective folder. 
I still need to implement the recursive search of sub-folders though, at the moment it sorts out just the folder where the program starts.
